  ## Testing<br />
  There are no formal tests used with this project, but you may try a few things out to test the user experience:<br />- Try entering a character value under 8 or above 128.<br />- Try clicking cancel at every prompt. The app will still generate a default 8 character all CAPS password.<br />
